Manage your backups, easily

# How should you backup your important files?

1. Multiple up to date copies in different locations (home, work, family, ...).
2. Simple directory structure that doesn't change over time.
2. Keep files in original format. Avoid proprietary or unpopular formats.
3. Cloud / RAID is not a backup. What happens if you delete your files from Dropbox's directory by accident?

Extremely large external hard drives (1TB+) make it easy to backup files. Create a nice directory structure and copy everything to the disk or to the cloud provider. But that will get a little difficult after a while when you save new versions of the files or make changes to the directory structure. How do you sync those changes between different backup locations?

Starburst is a file manager for distributed backups. First you scan all file locations on your computer(s) and then you scan all your existing backups. Starburst provides handy tools to organize and synchronize your backups even for larger amount of data (1TB+).
